This is a Python script to apply the changes found in "Fear and Hunger: Now In English" to the game automatically.

This allows for compatibility with other mods like Frapollo94's bugfixes.

Compatible with Windows only. Run the script and point it to the /www/data/ folder of your modded Fear & Hunger install, and this should apply on top.
